# ðŸ’¸ CashFlow â€“ MAD Project 1 Personal Finance Manager

Welcome to **CashFlow**, a simple yet powerful personal finance tracking app built with Flutter and SQLite! I built this app to help users keep track of income, expenses, and savings goals through clean logs and insightful visualizations.

  Where you add, edit, or delete transactions. The app auto-categorizes amounts: negative for expenses, positive for income.

  View pie charts of income and expenses and compare them against your savings goal. You can even adjust your goal on the fly.

### Categories:
- Income: `Paycheck`, `Refund`, `Dividends`
- Expense: `Rent`, `Food`, `Entertainment`, `Bill`
